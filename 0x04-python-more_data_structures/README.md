0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

Python Set
A Python set is the collection of the unordered items. Each element in the set must be unique, immutable, and the sets remove the duplicate elements. Sets are mutable which means we can modify it after its creation.

Unlike other collections in Python, there is no index attached to the elements of the set, i.e., we cannot directly access any element of the set by the index. However, we can print them all together, or we can get the list of elements by looping through the set.

Creating a set
The set can be created by enclosing the comma-separated immutable items with the curly braces {}. Python also provides the set() method, which can be used to create the set by the passed sequence.

Python Dictionary
Dictionaries are a useful data structure for storing data in Python because they are capable of imitating real-world data arrangements where a certain value exists for a given key.

The data is stored as key-value pairs using a Python dictionary.


This data structure is mutable
The components of dictionary were made using keys and values.
Keys must only have one component.
Values can be of any type, including integer, list, and tuple.

A dictionary is, in other words, a group of key-value pairs, where the values can be any Python object. The keys, in contrast, are immutable Python objects, such as strings, tuples, or numbers. Dictionary entries are ordered as of Python version 3.7. In Python 3.6 and before, dictionaries are generally unordered.

Creating the Dictionary
Curly brackets are the simplest way to generate a Python dictionary, although there are other approaches as well. With many key-value pairs surrounded in curly brackets and a colon separating each key from its value, the dictionary can be built. (:).
