0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

In Python, the sequence of various data types is stored in a list. A list is a collection of different kinds of values or items. Since Python lists are mutable, we can change their elements after forming. The comma (,) and the square brackets [enclose the List's items] serve as separators.

Although six Python data types can hold sequences, the List is the most common and reliable form. A list, a type of sequence data, is used to store the collection of data. Tuples and Strings are two similar data formats for sequences.

Lists written in Python are identical to dynamically scaled arrays defined in other languages, such as Array List in Java and Vector in C++. A list is a collection of items separated by commas and denoted by the symbol [].

The characteristics of the List are as follows:


The lists are in order.
The list element can be accessed via the index.
The mutable type of List is
The rundowns are changeable sorts.
The number of various elements can be stored in a list.

Python Tuples
A comma-separated group of items is called a Python triple. The ordering, settled items, and reiterations of a tuple are to some degree like those of a rundown, but in contrast to a rundown, a tuple is unchanging.The main difference between the two is that we cannot alter the components of a tuple once they have been assigned. On the other hand, we can edit the contents of a list.

Features of Python Tuple

Tuples are an immutable data type, meaning their elements cannot be changed after they are generated.
Each element in a tuple has a specific order that will never change because tuples are ordered sequences.
Forming a Tuple:
All the objects-also known as "elements"-must be separated by a comma, enclosed in parenthesis (). Although parentheses are not required, they are recommended.


Any number of items, including those with various data types (dictionary, string, float, list, etc.), can be contained in a tuple.
